title: Use Different Passwords
time: 1 hour
---
Let's say you use the same password on every single website. Let's be real -
it's most of us. >80% of people[^password-study] use the same password on every
website. Maybe you have a super secure 30 digit password with lots of capitals,
numbers, and symbols. Nobody could ever guess it (including maybe you...)

Nobody has to guess your password. Odds are that some website you use has
leaked their usernames and passwords as part of a data breach. You can check
out [HaveIBeenPwned][hibp] to see how many websites have leaked out your
usernames, passwords and the like. A hacker can grab your username and password
from one of these many leaks and then just log into every website they can
think of.

The best solution is to use a different, complicated password for every single
website. This can be really hard. Luckily, password managers can make it easy.
A password manager will securely store all of your passwords for you - one for
every account. When it's time to log in, your password manager will input in
the correct username and password for you automatically. It can make logging
into websites easier and more secure.  The two most popular are [LastPass][lastpass] and
[1Password][1password], although there's a bunch more[^pm-warning].


## Setting Up
1. Download a password manager app onto a computer.
2. Setup an account using a unique password. I'd recommend paying the monthly
   fee for cloud syncing (if there is a fee). It makes using a password manager with
3. Come up with a list of every digital account that your relatives have. At
   the very least, this list should have the following:
   * Email account
   * Facebook
   * Twitter
   * LinkedIn
   * Checking account
   * Investment accounts
   * Cell phone
4. Now comes the -boring- fun part! You have to log into each one of these
   accounts, change the password to be randomly generated, and then add the
   username/password to the password manager. Be sure to try logging into the
   account afterwards. I'd recommend *temporarily* copying the new randomly
   generated passwords to a text file until you're positive that your password
   manager has the correct password
5. Install your password manager on tablets + phones. Do not turn on biometric
   recognition. Be sure to log in to the password manager once to verify
   everything is working properly.

## Warnings!
* Most password managers don't handle changing passwords that well. Expect to
  be accidentally locked out of an account because your password manager didn't
  capture the password properly.  If they want to change
  passwords, have them copy all generated passwords into a text file
  temporarily and manually verify that the password manager has it remembered.

* If you're close with your relatives, write down a copy of their master
  password and store it in a secure place offline. This way, if they lose their
  password, you can help them recover access to their password vaults.

* Some websites will allow symbols in their passwords and others won't. Some
  websites limit password length to x characters, some don't. You should make
  sure your relatives know how to play around with the settings on the password
  generator

* Password managers can fill out your password field for you and that can be
  scary. Try creating a fake email account using the password manager and then
  try changing the password on that account using your password manager. Then
  try changing the password on the fake account using your password manager.
  This way, if something bad happens, you just lose access to your fake
  account.

* Some mobile apps will have a little icon to open a password manager and
  others will require manually copying + pasting passwords.

[^pm-manager]: There's a whole bunch of very, very bad password managers out
  there that can make you less secure. Be sure that you understand why your
  password manager is secure. Most password managers have security white-pages
  and you can Google around for basic primers on password manager security to
  know what to look for.
